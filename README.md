# Elyra examples

This repository provides a set of examples that explore some of the unique
features provided by Elyra. All examples require Elyra version 3.x.

Examples for earlier releases:
 - [`v2.2.x`](https://github.com/elyra-ai/examples/tree/v2.2.x)

## Pipelines

Use the Elyra Visual Pipeline Editor to [assemble pipelines from Python notebooks or scripts](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/pipelines.html) without the need for any coding.

### Pipeline tutorials

Tutorials to get started with generic pipelines in Elyra:
- [Introduction to generic pipelines](pipelines/introduction-to-generic-pipelines)
- [Run generic pipelines on Kubeflow Pipelines](pipelines/run-generic-pipelines-on-kubeflow-pipelines)
- [Run generic pipelines on Apache Airflow](pipelines/run-generic-pipelines-on-apache-airflow)
- [Run runtime-specific pipelines on Kubeflow Pipelines](pipelines/run-pipelines-on-kubeflow-pipelines)
- [Run runtime-specific pipelines on Apache Airflow](pipelines/run-pipelines-on-apache-airflow)
### Custom pipeline component examples

Pipeline nodes are implemented using
[components](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/pipeline-components.html). The following examples illustrate how to use custom components in runtime specific pipelines.

- [Custom components for Kubeflow Pipelines](pipelines/kubeflow_pipelines_component_examples)
- [Custom components for Apache Airflow](pipelines/airflow_component_examples)

### Pipeline component catalog connectors

Elyra loads [custom components](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/pipeline-components.html) from component catalogs:
- [Find catalog connectors](component-catalog-connectors/connector-directory.md)
- [Build a custom catalog connector](component-catalog-connectors/build-a-custom-connector.md)

### Example pipelines
This repository includes the following example pipelines:
- [Analyzing NOAA weather data](pipelines/dax_noaa_weather_data)
- [Visualize outputs in the Kubeflow Pipelines UI](pipelines/visualize_output_in_kubeflow_pipelines_ui)

### Example pipelines in third-party repositories
Pipelines that were created by the community:
- [Analyzing COVID-19 time series data](https://github.com/CODAIT/covid-notebooks)
- [Analyzing flight delays](https://github.com/CODAIT/flight-delay-notebooks)
