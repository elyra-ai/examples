## Component catalog connectors

Component catalog connectors provide Elyra's Visual Pipeline Editor access to [local and remote catalogs](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/pipeline-components.html#component-catalogs) that store [pipeline components](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/pipeline-components.html).
