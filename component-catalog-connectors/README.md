## Component catalog connectors

Component catalog connectors provide Elyra's Visual Pipeline Editor access to local and remote catalogs that store pipeline components. This directory contains the following component catalog connector implementations:
- [Kubeflow Pipelines example components](kfp-example-components-connector)
- [Apache Airflow example operators](airflow-example-components-connector)

The connectors listed above are maintained by the Elyra community. You can find a complete list of available connectors on [this page](connector-directory.md).
