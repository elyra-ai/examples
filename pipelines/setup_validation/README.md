## Pipeline runtime environment setup validation

Use the pipeline(s) in this directory to verify that your runtime environments and runtime configurations are set up properly.

### Validating the JupyterLab setup

To validate that you can run pipelines in your JupyterLab environment complete the steps below. If you are new to Elyra, please [review the introductory tutorial](https://github.com/elyra-ai/examples/tree/main/pipelines/hello_world) before proceeding.

1. In the File Explorer open `validate_python.pipeline` in the Visual Pipeline editor. The pipeline runs a trivial notebook and Python script.
1. In the Visual Pipeline editor click the "Run" button.
1. In the Run dialog choose `Local Runtime` as _Runtime Platform_.
1. Run the pipeline.

If the pipeline runs without any issues your basic setup is ok for Python scripts and notebooks that utilize a plain Python kernel.

### Validating a Kubeflow Pipelines setup

To validate that you can run pipelines in your JupyterLab environment complete the steps below. If you are new to Elyra, please [review the introductory tutorial](https://github.com/elyra-ai/examples/tree/main/pipelines/hello_world_kubeflow_pipelines) before proceeding.

Prerequisites:
- Kubeflow v1.2 or v1.3 is deployed
- [Runtime configuration is associated with this Kubeflow deployment](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/runtime-conf.html)

Steps:
1. In the File Explorer open `validate_python.pipeline` in the Visual Pipeline editor. The pipeline runs a trivial notebook and Python script.
1. In the Visual Pipeline editor click the "Run" button.
1. In the Run dialog choose `Kubeflow Pipelines` as _Runtime Platform_, and select the runtime configuration you've created.
1. Submit the pipeline. 
1. If the submission dialog indicates that an error occurred, check your runtime configuration and try again. 
1. If the submission succeeded open the Kubeflow Central dashboard link and [follow the monitoring steps outlined in the tutorial.](https://github.com/elyra-ai/examples/tree/main/pipelines/hello_world_kubeflow_pipelines#monitoring-a-pipeline-run)

### Validating an Apache Airflow setup

To validate that you can run pipelines in your Apache Airflow environment, follow the steps below. If you are new to Elyra, please [review the introductory tutorial](https://github.com/elyra-ai/examples/tree/main/pipelines/hello_world_apache_airflow) before proceeding.

1. [Create an Apache Airflow runtime configuration.](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/runtime-conf.html)
1. In the File Explorer open `validate_python.pipeline` in the Visual Pipeline editor. The pipeline runs a trivial notebook and Python script.
1. In the Visual Pipeline editor click the "Run" button.
1. In the Run dialog choose `Apache Airflow` as _Runtime Platform_, and select the runtime configuration you've created.
1. Submit the pipeline. 
1. If the submission dialog indicates that an error occurred, check your runtime configuration and try again. 
1. If the submission succeeded: 
   - Open the GitHub repository link and verify that a DAG with the pipeline name exists.
   - Open the Apache Airflow dashboard and [follow the monitoring steps outlined in the tutorial.](https://github.com/elyra-ai/examples/tree/main/pipelines/hello_world_apache_airflow#running-a-notebook-pipeline-on-apache-airflow)
