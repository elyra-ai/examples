This pipeline illustrates how to visualize metrics in the Kubeflow Pipelines Central Dashboard, as described in the [Visualizing output from your notebooks or Python scripts in the Kubeflow Pipelines UI](https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes/visualizing-output-in-the-kfp-ui.html) topic in the Elyra documentation.

- Review the `metrics.ipynb` notebook
- Run the pipeline on Kubeflow Pipelines 1.0 or later
